# Thinking Physically

The biggest takeaway from learning to use a pen plotter is how I am starting to think in more *physical* terms. For example, using centimetres in my algorithms rather than pixels on a screen. I've also started to discover ways of extending these algorithms into other dimensions, like exporting a parametric 3D model from JavaScript into a foldable paper model, or designing a generative artwork for a laser cutter.

I hope to explore these subjects in a different blog series on 3D geometry and parametric modelling in JavaScript.
